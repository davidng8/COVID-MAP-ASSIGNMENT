# Map of COVID-19 Rates and Map of COVID-19 Rates 

### Introduction
In this lab, I used data from the U.S. Census, The data used to compile these two web maps are U.S. Covid Rates and Counts from Census Tract per county. 

## Map #1 (Map of COVID Rates in the United States)
![MapOne](https://github.com/davidng8/covidmap/blob/main/img/Map%231%20WebMap.jpg)
[Map One Covid Rates](https://davidng8.github.io/covidmap/map1.html)
* This map shows data on the COVID-19 Rates in the U.S.
** The data used in this map was from the U.S. Census on COVID Rates, This map is a choropleth map demonstrating the COVID rates across County, As the color gets to a darker shade of red the value is higher to indicate a higher COVID-19 rate. 
** The map also has interactive features on the top-left side of the map it displays the information of both the state and county, and with value of that location to help the viewer know exactly what location they are looking at the exact value for that name. 

## Map #2 (Map of COVID Counts in the United States)

[Map Two Covid Counts](https://davidng8.github.io/covidmap/map2.html)
* This map shows data on the COVID-19 Counts, This map is a proportional symbol map demonstrating the COVID counts, the sizes of the dots vary based on value, according to legend as the dot gets bigger the higher value. making it easy to idenitify which location has the highest COVID counts.
